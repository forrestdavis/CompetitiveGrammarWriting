    "\n",
    "Your grammar should be sophisticated enough to parse\n",
    "a variety of English sentences, but it should not produce any ungrammatical\n",

    "how much it can cover.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is competitive (yet, friendly) grammar writing. Your\n",

    "* S2.gr\n",
    "This is a weighted context-free grammar that generates all possible sentences.\n",

    "is complicated and time is short, S2 will serve as your backoff model. (For\n",
    "details, see the Appendix.)\n",
    "\n",

    "the chalice .` but not `Guinevere goes the chalice .`, which is ungrammatical.\n",
    "This is why you may want to invent some new tags.\n",
    "\n",

    "probabilities sum up to one, so you can use any positive number as a weight. We\n",
    "renormalize them for you so that the weights for all the rules which rewrite a\n",
    "given non-terminal form a valid probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<parent>` is a non-terminal symbol. All children (e.g. `<child1>`) are either\n",
    "terminals or non- terminals. All rules are at most binary branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser will basically treat any symbols for which the grammar contains no\n",
    "rewrite rules as terminals and throw an error if it finds any such terminals not\n",
    "in the allowed words list. Also note that lines beginning with the `#` symbol\n",
    "are considered comments. You can give any of the utilities a set of files\n",
    "containing such rules, and they will merge the rules in each file into a single\n",
    "grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change these files however you like, and you can create new ones, too.\n",
    "However, you **must** not create new vocabulary words (terminals).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighting S1 and S2\n",
    "\n",
    "Two rules your grammar **must** include are `TOP -> S1` and `TOP -> S2`. (By\n",
    "default, these rules are in `S1.gr`.) The relative weight of these determines\n",
    "how likely it is that `S1.gr` (with start symbol `S1`) or `S2.gr` (with start\n",
    "symbol `S2`) would be selected in generating a sentence, and how costly it is to\n",
    "choose one or the other when parsing a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the relative weight of these two rules is a gamble. If you are\n",
    "over-confident in your \"real\" English grammar (`S1`), and you weight it too\n",
    "highly, then you risk assigning very low probability to sentences which `S1`\n",
    "cannot generate (since the parser will have to resort to your `S2` to get a\n",
    "parse, which gives every sentence a low score).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you weight `S2` too highly, then you will probably do a poor job of\n",
    "predicting the test set sentences, since `S2` will not make any sentences very\n",
    "likely. (It accepts everything, so probability mass is spread very thin across\n",
    "the space of word strings.) Of course, you can invest some effort in trying to\n",
    "make `S2` a better n-gram model, but that's a tedious task and a risky\n",
    "investment.\n",
    "\n",
